    text: "Soleil Rouge, while keeping the specific elegance of Cru Livinière wines, offers a crunchy fruit and velvet mouth. A Livinière wine that you can drink young without waiting, with volume and freshness. This wine has two secrets: limited use of wood, with partial use of three years oak barrels; and use of Cinsault in the final blend, in order to provide more crunchy fruit… The result is there: Soleil Rouge offers a modern and attractive style of Livinière Cru.",

    text: "Les Trois Écus is Domaine Michelin’s classic style of Livinière Cru. An elegant and fruity wine, with volume and persistence. It is the result of 18 months aging minimum, including 12 months in 300L French Oak Barrels, with one third of new barrels every year. The selection of the new barrels is made very carefully, every year, according to the profile of the vintage. We aim at selecting barrels which will bring complexity and aging potential to the wine, without masking the aromas. We want to keep fruit after aging… Les Trois Écus wines are ready to drink when put on the market. But they will take benefit of additional time in your cellar for aging if you are patient enough.",

    text: "Générations is the brand name for our “Tête de Cuvée”. The most outstanding wine we can produce for a given vintage. The final name of the Cuvée depends on the year. “Axel” (2015), “Elias” (2016), “Yuna” (2017), “Malone” (2018), “Anouk” (2020). These are the names of our grandsons and granddaughters, born these last years. Lucky us… \nThis Cuvée is the selection, each year, of the very best barrels of the vintage in very limited volumes: 800 to 1000 bottles only. At the end of the aging of the vintage, we taste individually each barrel. And every year, we find gems: some of the barrels are exceptional and allow to produce a top-quality blend. Générations Cuvée is therefore a very unique Cuvée, different every year, every year at the top.",

This wine provides immediate tasting pleasure, with intense nose of red fruits with mouth all in sweetness. This is an easy wine to drink for aperitif or ideal for barbecues. You can also serve it lightly chilled at 14° during summer…  Its vinification by partial carbonic maceration allows the extraction of maximum aromas.",

The fresh and ventilated terroir, 350m high, with limestone soil, produces a mineral, elegant ang very persistent white wine, with white flowers and fruits aromas. Very limited production (2000 bottles a year, on average). A typical wine for gastronomy, ideal with refined dishes, such as fish, white meat, goat cheese…",

An easy to drink, fresh, fruity and full-bodied white, ideal for drinking as such, or for any summer food, fish, cheese. We also produce, out of the same plot, a barrel (400L) aged version called “Le Bois de la Martelle”.
