They both have spent a lot of time in the vines for harvest, in the cellar for various tasks.\n- Martin, Camille and Etienne, Michel’s children. Martin is involved in the material and equipment of the cellar, while Camille and Etienne provide their support on communications and marketing matters. Not forgetting Christine, Michel’s wife, always ready to give a hand, whatever the need!\n\nAnd of course, the picture would not be complete, if we forgot to mention the temporary staff who joins the winery at every harvest season. Over the years, special relationships have been established, like the one with Maria and her family, who live right nearby and whose regular participation allows the estate to face its activity peaks.
